<h2>How to play Hangman</h2>

<p>Computer choose a random word or phrase; You (user) try to guess what it is one letter at a time. The player draws a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If a guessing player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the computer fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the computer draws one element of a hangmanâ€™s gallows.</p>
